# Splunk SDK for C# 
### Version 2.0 pre-release

> **Important:** The Splunk Software Development Kit (SDK) for C# version 2.0 
> is a complete rewrite of the Splunk SDK for C# version 1.0, and introduces

> [Compatibility](#compat).

The Splunk SDK for C# v2.0 contains library code and examples designed to 
enable developers to build applications using Splunk Enterprise.

Splunk Enterprise is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a 
distributed map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search, and process 
large time-varying data sets.

The Splunk Enterprise product is popular with system administrators for 
aggregation and monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a 
wide variety of other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently 
index, search, analyze, and generate real-time notifications from large 
volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk Enterprise product to build exciting 
new applications that are enabled by Splunk Enterprise's unique capabilities.

## What's new in Version 2.0

Version 2.0 introduces new modern APIs that leverage the latest .NET platform advancements. 

* Async - All APIs are 100% asynchronous supporting the new [async/await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx) features.
* All APIs follow .NET guidelines and abide by FxCop and StyleCop rules.
* Reactive Extensions - Splunk Enterprise query results implement [IObservable<T>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd990377), allowing usage with the [.NET Reactive Extensions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/gg577610).
* Support for multiple platforms - The Splunk API client (Splunk.Client.dll) in the new version is a [Portable Class Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/gg597391.aspx).

Below is an example of a simple normal search:

```csharp
using Splunk.Client;

var service = new Service(Scheme.Https, "localhost", 8089));

//login
await service.LoginAsync("admin", "changeme");

//create a job
var job = await service.StartJobAsync("search index=_internal | head 10");

//get the results
var searchResults = await job.GetSearchResultsAsync());

//loop through the results
foreach (var record in searchResults)
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0:D8}: {1}", ++recordNumber, record));
}
```

## Supported platforms

.NET 4.5, PCL (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1, iOS (via Xamarin.iOS), Android (via Xamarin.Android)

## [Compatibility](id:compat)

The Splunk SDK for C# version 2.0 is a rewrite of the existing SDK, and introduces completely new APIs. 

__Important: Applications built with Splunk SDK for C# version 1.x will not recompile using Splunk SDK for C# version 2.0.__

Splunk SDK for C# version 2.0 includes a subset of the capability in version 1.0 of the SDK, and focuses on the most common scenarios that we have seen customers using. The major focus areas are _search_, _search jobs_, _configuration_, and _modular inputs_.

Following is a breakdown of the areas covered:

* Login
* Access control (users and passwords)
* Searches (normal, blocking, oneshot, and export)
* Jobs
* Reports ("saved searches" in Splunk Enterprise 5)
* Configuration and Config Properties
* Indexes
* Inputs (sending simple and streamed events to Splunk Enterprise)
* Applications
* Modular inputs

For detailed API coverage, see this [coverage matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lTlJ_z4tBpn_xPnJNDapiAxwdtQWvFGH31G6WIkMYwU/edit#gid=0).

We will publish guidance on how to migrate applications built using the Splunk SDK for C# 1.x to use the Splunk SDK for C# 2.0.

## Getting started with the Splunk SDK for C# 

The Splunk SDK for C# contains library code and examples that show how to 
programmatically interact with Splunk for a variety of scenarios including 
searching, saved searches, data inputs, and many more, along with building 
complete applications. 

The information in this Readme provides steps to get going quickly. In the 
future we plan to roll out more in-depth documentation.

### Requirements

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk SDK for C# version 2.0.

#### Splunk Enterprise

If you haven't already installed Splunk Enterprise, download it at 
<http://www.splunk.com/download>. For more information about installing and 
running Splunk Enterprise and system requirements, see the
[Splunk Installation Manual](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation). 

#### Developer environments

* The Splunk SDK for C# supports development in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and later.  Visual Studio downloads are available on the 
[Visual Studio Downloads webpage](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/downloads).
* Support for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop is in progress.

#### Splunk SDK for C# 

[Get the Splunk SDK for C#](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl/archive/master.zip). Download the ZIP file and extract its contents.

If you are interested in contributing to the Splunk SDK for C#, you can 
[get it from GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp) and clone the 
resources to your computer.

### Building the SDK

Before starting to develop custom software, you must first build the SDK. Once 
you've downloaded and extracted—or cloned—the SDK, do the following:

1. At the root level of the **splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl** directory, open the 
**splunk-sdk-csharp-pcl.sln** file in Visual Studio.
2. On the **BUILD** menu, click **Build Solution**.

This will build the SDK, the examples, and the unit tests.

### Examples and unit tests

The Splunk SDK for C# includes full unit tests which run using [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit). Examples are a work in progress.

### Changelog

The **CHANGELOG.md** file in the root of the repository contains a description
of changes for each version of the SDK. You can also find it online at
[https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). 

### Branches

The **master** branch always represents a stable and released version of the SDK.
You can read more about our branching model on our Wiki at 
[https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-csharp/wiki/Branching-Model](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-java/wiki/Branching-Model).
